"DNS:
Domain Name Servers (DNS) are the Internet’s equivalent of a phone book. They maintain a directory of domain names (e.g., www.example.com) and translate them into Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (e.g., 192.0.2.1). This translation is necessary because, while domain names are easy for people to remember, computers and other devices access websites using IP addresses.
Internet Connection:
An internet connection is the ability to link to the Internet using devices such as computers, smartphones, or other terminals, thereby enabling access to online services like email and the World Wide Web.
Server Connection:
The app requests speed-test resources from a server. If the connection between client devices (such as your cellphone) and the server is unstable or fails, the app won’t be able to retrieve the necessary resources, resulting in a failed speed test." =

"Since many websites and streaming services host their content on servers located in different regions, speed test results from a single server may be inaccurate (for example, when you're using a VPN to access the internet). To provide the most reliable speed test, the system uses the server closest to your location." =

"Definition:
A ping test is primarily used to check the responsiveness and stability of a connected network.

Principle:
Because every IP address or URL is unique, your device sends a small test data packet to the target IP address or URL and requests that the destination return a packet of the same size. This process determines whether the two devices are successfully connected over the internet and measures the round-trip time—also known as latency or response time—between them.

Packet Loss Rate:
Packet loss rate refers to the percentage of data packets that fail to reach their destination during the test relative to the total number of packets sent. It is a key indicator of network quality. Packet loss is typically influenced by two main factors: the network connection itself and the router.

Latency:
Latency, also called response time, is the duration it takes for a data packet to travel from your device to the target server and back. The shorter the response time, the faster your device communicates with the tested IP address or URL. Generally, latency between 0 and 100 milliseconds (ms) is considered excellent and unlikely to cause noticeable lag or stuttering." =
